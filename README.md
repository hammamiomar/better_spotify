# Betterd Spotify ðŸŽµ

A fullstack Rust web application that provides **true random shuffling** for Spotify playlists â€“ because Spotify's "shuffle" isn't really random.

## Why This Exists

This project was born out of two motivations:
1. **Learning Rust**: I wanted to practice Rust and build my first fullstack application with it
2. **Fixing Spotify's Shuffle**: Spotify's shuffle algorithm is frustratingly biased toward "favorite" tracks, playing the same songs repeatedly instead of giving you a genuine random experience from your entire playlist

## The Problem with Spotify's Shuffle

Spotify uses a weighted algorithm that prioritizes songs it thinks you want to hear based on your listening history. While this might sound good in theory, it means:
- Large playlists effectively become small playlists of the same 50-100 songs
- You never discover forgotten gems in your own playlists
- The "shuffle" experience becomes predictable and boring

## Current Features âœ…

### True Random Shuffle
- Creates a genuinely randomized copy of any Spotify playlist
- Preserves the original playlist (creates a new one with "_TRUE SHUFFLED_" suffix)
- Maintains playlist cover art
- Handles playlists of any size with batch processing

### User Experience
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Spotify
- Clean, responsive UI built with TailwindCSS
- Real-time progress tracking during shuffle operations
- Search and filter through your playlists
- Profile display with user information

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rust + Axum
- **Frontend**: Dioxus (Rust-based React-like framework)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- **API Integration**: Spotify Web API via reqwest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Node.js (for TailwindCSS)
- Spotify Developer Account

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/betterd_spotify.git
cd betterd_spotify
```

2. Create a Spotify App:
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Add `http://localhost:8080/callback` to Redirect URIs
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

3. Create a `.env` file:
```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/callback
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Run the Rust server
dx serve --platform web

# Terminal 2 - Watch CSS changes
npm run watch:css
```

6. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Authenticate with your Spotify account
2. **Select Playlist**: Browse and search through your playlists
3. **Shuffle**: Click on a playlist to create a truly randomized version
4. **Enjoy**: Find your new shuffled playlist in Spotify and enjoy the variety!

## Currently Working On ðŸš§

- **SQL Database**: Implementing multi user token storage for deployment
- **Deployment**: Preparing for production deployment

## Planned Features ðŸš€

### Advanced Playlist Management
- **Genre Extraction**: Extract all songs of a specific genre from a playlist
- **BPM Filtering**: Create playlists based on tempo/BPM ranges
- **Mood-based Playlists**: Group songs by audio features (energy, danceability, etc.)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and remove duplicate tracks across playlists
- **Smart Merging**: Combine multiple playlists with deduplication

### Additional Features
- **Shuffle History**: Track and replay previous shuffles
- **Scheduled Shuffles**: Automatically refresh shuffled playlists periodically
- **Collaborative Shuffles**: Share shuffle patterns with friends
- **Analytics**: Visualize your listening patterns and playlist composition
